You have been granted standard production access including the below API functionality. Please note that you no longer need to contact the USPS for access to these services:
        Price Calculators
        Package Tracking
        Service Standards and Commitments

Permissions for validating addresses, creating shipping labels, and scheduling Package Pickups are added separately. Should you have an interest in obtaining these permissions or if your software provider requires them, please contact our Internet Customer Care Center (uspstechnicalsupport@mailps.custhelp.com) and include "Web Tools API Access" in the subject line. An agent will be happy to assist you.

For more details on direct integration, refer to the latest versions of the technical documentation, including the Developer Guide, at https://www.usps.com/webtools.  If you are using a third party shipping software or shopping cart provider, please refer to their customer service resources for instructions for use, key updates and other support.
